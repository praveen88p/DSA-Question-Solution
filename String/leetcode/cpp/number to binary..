writing a functino that will convert any number to it's binary string


string convet2Binary(int n){
string res = "";
while(n!= 1){
if(n%2 == 1) res+= '1';
else res+= '0';
n = n/2;
}
reverse(res);
return res;
}


Time Complexcity is  = Loge base 2 n   ---(whenever you divide any number then its time complexcity become this)
Space Complexcity is = Loge base 2 n   ---(becous the number of step you are take is equal to the number of reminde which we are storing in the staring)
