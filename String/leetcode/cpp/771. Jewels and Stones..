You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int count = 0; 
        unordered_map<char , int > m;
        for(int i = 0; i< stones.size(); i++){
            m[stones[i]]++;
        }

        for(int j = 0 ; j< jewels.size(); j++){
              auto it = m.find(jewels[j]);  
              if(it != m.end()){
                count = count + it->second;
              }
            
        }
        return count;
    }
